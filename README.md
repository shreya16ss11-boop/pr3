# ReserveHub

ReserveHub is a full-stack appointment booking platform for service businesses. It includes a public booking experience, service catalog, staff coverage, availability-based time slots, appointment management, status updates, dashboard metrics, activity history, and sample-record restoration for local review.

The application is built as a real frontend/backend project with working API validation and double-booking protection.

## Development Evidence

- Real source code
- FastAPI backend with SQLite persistence
- Pydantic request validation
- Service, staff, slot, appointment, dashboard, activity, and restore endpoints
- Backend double-booking protection
- Backend tests: 11 passed
- Frontend tests: 4 passed
- Production frontend build verified
- Real screenshots captured from the running app

## Sample Records Notice

ReserveHub includes seeded services, staff members, availability, appointments, and activity records for local development and portfolio review. These records can be restored from the admin schedule view or through the API.

## Deployment Notes

The project is structured for later deployment as two services:

- Static React frontend
- FastAPI backend with a persistent database

For production, move SQLite to a managed database, configure production CORS origins, add authentication for admin routes, and disable public sample-record restoration.

## Future Improvements

- Admin authentication
- Email confirmations
- Calendar export
- Staff-specific booking links
- Recurring availability editor
- Payment deposits
- Multi-location support
- Deployment pipeline and test badges
